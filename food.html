            <h2>Kushari</h2>
            <p>
                Koshary, kushari or koshari (Egyptian Arabic: كشرى [ˈkoʃæɾi]) is Egypt's national dish and a widely popular street food.
                [1] It is a traditional Egyptian staple, mixing pasta, Egyptian fried rice, vermicelli and brown lentils,[2]
                [3] and topped with chickpeas, a garlicky tomato sauce, garlic vinegar, and crispy fried onions.
                 Sprinklings of garlic vinegar and hot sauce are optional.

            <h2>Fool and Taameya</h2>
            <p>
                Ful mudammas and Ta’meya are the original Egyptian fast food;
                 they are a staple of the Egyptian diet. The ful (pronounced: fool) is made of fava beans that are simmered all night in a massive round cauldron-looking pot called Qedra.
                  The ta’meya, or Egyptian falafel is made out of crushed fava beans that is later mixed and made into a paste then fried,
                 unlike Lebanese falafel that is made out of hummus. Perfect for vegetarians.
