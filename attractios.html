                <h2>The Pyramids</h2>
                <p>The pyramids of ancient Egypt were tombs. 
                    Egyptian kings had themselves buried with gold and other treasure.

                <p>Khan el-Khalili (Arabic: خان الخليلي) is a famous bazaar in the historic center of Cairo, Egypt.
                      Established as a center of trade in the Mamluk era and named for one of its several historic caravanserais,
                     the bazaar district has since become one of Cairo's main attractions for tourists and Egyptians alike.
